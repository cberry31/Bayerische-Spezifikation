<div class="aboutContainer">
  <p>Bayerische-Spezifikation is translated to Bavarian-Specifications in german and is used as a description of this sites functions and the name of the webpage.
    This site was made as a BMW vehicle wiki that provides information on cars from the '70s '80s and '90s.
    There are eleven cars currently on the wiki with more to be added in the future.
    Each car is listed with a description and all general statistics of the car including horsepower and models of the car.
    The cars are listed in terms of their chassis numbers, for example e28 or e30 for the 5 series and 3 series in the 1980's.
    Using the Compare tab on the top of the site will allow you to compare the specifications of two cars, side by side.
    Using the Car List tab on the top of the site will allow you to see a generated list of all cars available on this website, by clicking a car you can view car specific information.
    This site was designed by Colton Berry, Quinn Croes and McGuire Croes while attending WSU Vancouver.
